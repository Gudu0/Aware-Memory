Aware Memory Suggestions

borg - also an idea - maybe instead of centering, allow treating belts as two "channels" - so players can double the throughput if they are using both sides (that assumes you'll put limits on belt's throughput in the first place)

vast -  why we have a belt that moves items to the center of the belt - so I ask the question why not just have the belts do it anyway
